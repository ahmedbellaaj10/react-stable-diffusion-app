# Stable Diffusion Image Generator

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

Welcome to the Stable Diffusion Image Generator, a React application that uses the stable diffusion model to generate images based on the user's prompt. This project is designed to provide a simple and easy-to-use interface for generating stunning images with just a few clicks.

## Introduction
The Stable Diffusion Image Generator is an open-source project that allows users to create beautiful images by simply entering a prompt. The application uses the stable diffusion model to generate images that are unique and visually appealing. With just a few clicks, users can create their own custom images that can be used for a wide range of applications.

## API Integration
Note that the Stable Diffusion Image Generator works in conjunction with an API project based on FastAPI. The API project provides the machine learning capabilities necessary to generate the images based on user input. You can find the link to the API project <a href="https://github.com/ahmedbellaaj10/stable-diffusion-api">here</a>
